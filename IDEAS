NOTE: There are about 160 words that have .a.es pattern.

The words we do worst on in wordle3.py are those that have this pattern in spite of the fact
that we are rewarded with 3 or the correct words in the correct spot. So, we need to precalculate
the best second guess if our grade is .2.22 (the worst words are those with the two unknown letters
being absent from the grade).

first word: lares
if > 60 words remaining then
  second word: tones
